ctrlaltt is a free program with a single purpose.
It is supposed to open a WSL console on Windows when
pressing the key combination CTRL+ALT+T. It can be made
to execute any command upon pressing that key combination
by passing the command as the last passed argument to the
program. There is currently no mechanism for modifying the
key combination. The only way to kill the program is to
run the taskkill command from cmd or powershell. This program
is made to be executed only on windows.

The default command executed when pressing the key combination
is exactly, `bash ~`.
